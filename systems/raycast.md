# Raycast

Extensibility analysis of the launcher called [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com).


## Positives

- Increased user agency through the quicklinks system that allows for easy creation of commands without needing to create your own extension (more on this later).
- Easy to install extensions through the Raycast [store](https://www.raycast.com/store).
- Broad range of extension categories, many use-cases.
- Extension starting template generator in Raycast itself.
- Extensions can be imported.
- All extensions are open-source and located in their [Github repo](https://github.com/raycast/extensions).
- Encrypted user data.


## Negatives

- Automatic updates, legitimate extensions can turn malicious.
- No permission system.
- No sandboxing.
- Need to be signed in to import an extension, or to create an extension from a template.
- VC-funded.


## Impediments

These may be positive or negative, depending on the way you look at it.

- All extensions on the store go through a review process.
- Extensions use web tech (React).


## Threat models

The extensions inherit the permissions from Raycast itself. Whatever Raycast can access, the extensions can access. No sandboxing, so your security is entirely depend on how well the reviewers from the Raycast team have done their job; because most likely Raycast will have access to all your files.


## Quicklinks

Allows for any URL, not just HTTPS, to be generated by a command that you type into Raycast; and then subsequently opened in an application that the user configured. The command arguments become query parameters.

## Alternatives

Specifically with Raycast extension compatibility.

### Vicinae

An [open-source](https://github.com/vicinaehq/vicinae) alternative with a current focus on Linux, with its [own extensions store](https://github.com/vicinaehq/extensions) besides Raycast compatibility.

### Other
